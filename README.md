Using the Quandl API to extract stock information, I am analyzing the performace of 5 stocks during Q4 of 2018, when there was a steep market selloff. You will find calulations for variance and standard deviation to measure stock volitaliy. In addition, we will look into the relationships between stocks using covariance and correlation as well constructing matrices to compare stocks. All analysis is done in Jupyter Notebook using Python.
